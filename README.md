# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard allows a user to search for a city and see the day's weather forecast as well as the 5-day forecast for that city. Each searched city is saved for the user to re-visit using local storage. I was able to use the OpenWeatherMap API for the weather data, and I used Bootstrap for styling.
